# ModalSound
This project releases the educational C++ code used at SIGGRAPH 2016 Course "Physically Based Sound for Computer Animation and Virtual Environments".

There are two sub-projects, _IsoStuffer_ and _ModalSound_.

_IsoStuffer_ is an implementation of [[Labelle and Shewchuk 2007]](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/papers/stuffing.pdf). It provides the functionality to construct a tetrahedral mesh from a water-tight triangle mesh.
